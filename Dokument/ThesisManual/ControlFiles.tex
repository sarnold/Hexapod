The control-structure is described in the master thesis report.
Here most of the control files will be described.

The full system is triggered by a trigger-system in order to keep control of execution order.
The trigger system is saved as a library and linked to from the various implementations.
Trigger system library can be found under Simulink{\_}Lib/Control.
Here is also the rest of the control libraries located.
IK, MainController, coordinate translater and a test sequence exists.
The most advanced one of these is the main controller.
If development of the controller is to be done it is inside this it can be performed.
The controller implementation utilizes written m-files.
These are located at Control/MatlabFunctions and are explained by comments in the code.

There is a folder located as Control/LegConstriants.
The script inside is used to get a visualization of the constraint boundaries that can be used for the legs. 
Script is hopefully self explanatory.
